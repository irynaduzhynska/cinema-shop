This project was build with minding N-tier architecture. Only back-end side included, 
of course. KISS, DRY, SOLID are the main principles.

- MySQL
- Tomcat Server

Only authenticated users can use the full functionality of the app. 
Only login and sign up pages. After a user is registered, they are assigned the 'USER' 
role by default. Users can have only two roles: USER and ADMIN. Also, it is predicted 
that roles can be combined. So if a user has two roles - they can perform both sets of 
actions.

Admin user is created automatically while starting. email: roman@in.ua, password: roman
When you call controller`s method authenticate, you will get JWT token which later you will able use 
with key word Bearer in Authorization header in postman to send other requests.
  
#### Before calling methods review SecurityConfig class and notice to which url USER and ADMIN can send requests
